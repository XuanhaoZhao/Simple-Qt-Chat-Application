# Qt chat application
This is the source code of a Qt chat application, which is a homework in the course "Basic internship in computer science" in Beijing Institute of Technology, in the summer of 2022.
We have implemented some basic functions.Now we can use it to send texts, pictures, small files, add friends, create chat groups.
You can download the src and use Qt to try it!
